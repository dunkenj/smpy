Stellar populations and Masses with Python
==========================================

This package contains Python software designed for building and processing composite stellar populations in a simple but flexible manner. It allows for easy synthetic photometry to be produced for single models or large suites of models.

The code makes use of the `Astropy <https://astropy.readthedocs.org>`_ module throughout and therefore allows for easy conversion of physical units and a wide range of allowed cosmologies.

Currently supported simple stellar population models are:

1. `Bruzual & Charlot 2003 <http://www.bruzual.org/bc03/Updated_version_2012/>`_
2. `BPASS V1 & V2 <http://bpass.auckland.ac.nz/>`_
